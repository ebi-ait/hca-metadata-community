# HCA Metadata Standard

Motivation for having a Metadata Standard:

The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) is developing a community-driven Metadata Standard for Single-Cell Biology data. The standard underpins the data life-cycle from contribution and analysis, through to subsequent sharing and reuse. The vision of the standard is to make the digital research outputs of the Single Cell Biology community Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable, according to [FAIR principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).

The motivation behind the development of the HCA Metadata Standard is to:

* Enable data contributors to describe their project in a way that produces high-quality data that can be maximally exploited by consumers and developers.
* Enable data consumers to interpret data efficiently and in a standardized way.
* Ensure the data collected by the community supports building spatially resolved atlases of cell types and states.
* Support developers who rely on metadata to develop and implement analysis and visualization tools.
