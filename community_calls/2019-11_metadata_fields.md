## Summary

### <i class="fas fa-search"></i> Key learnings

- There is lack of alignment in metadata at the level of tissue collection 
- There is a lot of organ-specific metadata and disease-specific metadata - which might not be relevant in all the cases, how to reconcile?
- Need to include the metadata of where the tissue sample has been collected - overview images, anatomograms, ideally CCF

### <i class="far fa-comment-dots"></i> Needs from the community
- Align tissue sample metadata between tissue providers 
- Involvement in determining what is required, optional, valuable metadata
  
### <i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i> Ideas for how to action
- Efforts on metadata alignment between HCA, HDBR and CBTM (already ongoing)
- HCA metadata in an easy to access, easy to circulate form for contributors.
- Call for the community to submit their metadata to identify needed fields and rank based on Importance - from Contributor’s view, Importance - from Consumer’s view, Ease of obtaining - then distribute it in user-friendly form.
- Find out about other efforts on metadata harmonisation (in other Consortia for example, mentioned efforts in the US, NIH)
- Make HCA metadata standard easily accessible (Action plan - Metadata standard webpage accessible for the community!)
