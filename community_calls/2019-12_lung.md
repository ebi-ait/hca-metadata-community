## Summary

### <i class="fas fa-search"></i> Key learnings

- Many groups working on lung across Europe and US, different aspects - development, disease, adult lung, mouse lung
- Some groups collect extended annotation towards location of the sample within the organ (Pascal Barbry)
- Fabian Theisâ€™ lab - effort to understand variation - both normal and abnormal - by integration of many different datasets - based on the provided metadata
- The more metadata the better to identify batch effects

### <i class="far fa-comment-dots"></i> Needs from the community
- Align metadata within the Lung community
- Integrate different data within the Lung community
- Determine what metadata is needed for the imaging data - FISH
- Documenting location of origin of the sample 
- Basic demographic data, clinical/smoking data, etc
- Use of ontologies to ensure interoperability
- Collect as much metadata as possible to enable batch effect correction
  
### <i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i>  Ideas for how to action
- Organ specialists to collaborate with ontology experts to review existing ontologies, suggest addition of new ones
- Collect additional metadata (clinical data) - this is helpful for batch correction
- Provide guidelines, document best practices for depicting the location of origin of sample
- Find out a way to link overview images of the sample to the data submission to the HCA
- Expand HCA metadata to support imaging experiments
